        <h2>The Taj Mahal</h2></center>
        <h3>The Taj Mahal welcomes an astonishing 35 to 40 thousand visitors every day — and with busy seasons,it is no stranger to upto 8 million visitors annually.The origin of this marbled expression of love lies in the celebrated reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan 400 years ago. This leader had a desire to build a monument to the object of his affection and favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Ultimately, it exists as a tomb for her, but she is certainly one of the few people who will not be forgotten as time goes by.</h3>

        <h2>Great Wall of China</h2></center>
        <h3>A creation that serves as one of the largest archives of historical documents and a morgue, the Great Wall of China has gone far beyond its original purpose as just a defensive measure. Let's unpack that: because it was in construction for nearly 2,000 years by separate dynasties, inscriptions, and corpses are carved and buried onto and into this megalithic icon. Furthermore, tourist hype forced Chinese authorities to implement a daily limit of 65,000 visitors in places like the Badaling section of the Great Wall. It is hard to estimate the total annual visitors due to it being 5,500 miles (8,851 km) long, but around 150 million inbound tourists visit Beijing each year, and travel bloggers frequently claim that almost all tourists visiting Beijing are planning to check out the wall.</h3>

        <h2>The Colosseum</h2></center>
        <h3>Emperors are addicted to cementing their legacy by constructing incredible, wonders ,and the relationship between Emperor Vespasian & the Colosseum he commissioned is no different. The project was so grand that it was his son Titus' responsibility to complete it, and Emperor Domitian earned a little credit by making substantial modifications. Roman concrete, limestone, and volcanic rock were essential ingredients to this 50,000-spectator arena, and earthquakes and stone thieves tried and failed to tear it down.</h3>

        <h2>Petra, Jordan</h2></center>
        <h3>"This is impossible" is a common thought for those who stand beneath the carved red-rock mountains in Petra. Yet, there it is. This ancient trading hub is larger than any painting or picture can capture, which is a reality that its one million annual visitors can understand. The buildings, sculpted straight out of the canyon walls, would have been endangered by sudden flash floods, but the Nabateans (a wealthy arab kingdom) designed  complex water control system to manage this.Due to the desert climate, they even installed an intricate series of dams, canals, and reservoirs into the rock faces to maintain a consistent water supply for 20,000 inhabitants. Those grooves still exist in the rock walls today, collecting moisture the same way as they did two thousand years ago.</h3>

        <h2>Chichén Itzá</h2></center>
        <h3>This site is a golden example to prove that Egyptians were not the only ones capable of constructing enormous pyramids. The largest structure, El Castillo, is 98 feet and utilizes 365 stone steps to represent the solar year. The Maya people went beyond just sheer scale: during the equinoxes, a mystical shadow appears due to ingenious engineering, and a serpent's shadow appears to slither down the staircase. Naturally, this attention to detail means that the whole area was a religious, political, and economic center for the Mayan civilization that seems to have vanished overnight, abandoning all settlements by 900 CE. Stone tools were enough to create this 5 km2 complex, which is one of the reasons it fits as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Astronomy and acoustics were common sciences in this city, which is fitted with an ancient observatory, and whispers at one end of the Ball Court can be heard 135 meters away at the other end. Human sacrifices were performed here, but thankfully, its 3 million yearly visitors will not have to witness those extinct practices</h3>

        <h2>Christ The Redeemer</h2></center>
        <h3>The Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro is an awe--inspiring symbol of both faith and architectural brilliance.. Overlooking the city from atop Mount Corcovado, this religious icon is visited by almost 2 million people per year. Initiated in the period following World War I, its creation from 1926 to 1931 was a collective endeavor involving Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. With a striking height of 98 feet and its arms reaching 92 feet wide, it's a marvel to behold. </h3>

        <h2>Machu Picchu</h2></center>
        <h3>Can you imagine the astonishment of those who discovered this metropolis, seemingly floating on clouds between mountains? The Machu Picchu, perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is a stone's throw from Cuzco. Although it was well known to the local people, the West took note of it in 1911 when it was spotted by the American explorer Hiram Bingham. It was initially believed to be Vilcabamba, a hidden Incan haven during the Spanish resistance. The genuine intent behind this 15th-century structure, however, remains debated, with suggestions that it served as a sanctuary for the revered 'Virgins of the Sun,' a place of worship, or perhaps a regal escape.</h3>
