        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the most remarkable creations of classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in Mesopotamia. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently, plus the sun and moon.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">Many similar lists have been made.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">The historian Herodotus (484 – ca. 425 BCE), and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene (ca. 305 – 240 BCE) at the Museum of Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders. Their writings have not survived, except as references.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">The classic seven wonders were:</p>
        <ol style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">
            <li>The Great Pyramid of Giza</li>
            <li>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon</li>
            <li>The Statue of Zeus at Olympia</li>
            <li>The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus</li>
            <li>The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</li>
            <li>The Colossus of Rhodes</li>
            <li>The Lighthouse of Alexandria</li>
        </ol>
